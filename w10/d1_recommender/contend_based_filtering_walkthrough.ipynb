    "\n",
    "* Simple recommenders: offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. An example could be IMDB Top 250.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Content-based recommenders: suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person likes a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it. And to recommend that, it will make use of the user's past item metadata. A good example could be YouTube, where based on your history, it suggests you new videos that you could potentially watch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering engines: these systems are widely used, and they try to predict the rating or preference that a user would give an item-based on past ratings and preferences of other users. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts."

    "Some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Introduce a popularity filter: this recommender would take the 30 most similar movies, calculate the weighted ratings (using the IMDB formula from above), sort movies based on this rating, and return the top 10 movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other crew members: other crew member names, such as screenwriters and producers, could also be included.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The increasing weight of the director: to give more weight to the director, he or she could be mentioned multiple times in the soup to increase the similarity scores of movies with the same director.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering with Python\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have learned how to build your very own Simple and Content-Based Movie Recommender Systems. There is also another extremely popular type of recommender known as collaborative filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filters can further be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "* User-based Filtering: these systems recommend products to a user that similar users have liked. For example, let's say Alice and Bob have a similar interest in books (that is, they largely like and dislike the same books). Now, let's say a new book has been launched into the market, and Alice has read and loved it. It is, therefore, highly likely that Bob will like it too, and therefore, the system recommends this book to Bob.\n",
    "* Item-based Filtering: these systems are extremely similar to the content recommendation engine that you built. These systems identify similar items based on how people have rated it in the past. For example, if Alice, Bob, and Eve have given 5 stars to The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, the system identifies the items as similar. Therefore, if someone buys The Lord of the Rings, the system also recommends The Hobbit to him or her."
