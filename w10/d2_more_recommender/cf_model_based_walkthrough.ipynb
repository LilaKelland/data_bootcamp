    "Many traditional methods for training recommender systems are bad at making predictions due to a process known as overfitting. Overfitting in the context of recommender systems means our model will be good at fitting to the data we have, but bad at recommending new products to customers (not ideal given that is their purpose). This is because there is so much missing information\n",

    "#### Recommender Systems and Matrix Factorisation\n",
    "The data input for a recommender system can be thought of as a large matrix, with the rows indicating an entry for a customer, and the columns indicating an entry for a particular item. Let’s call this matrix 𝑅. Then entry 𝑅𝒾𝑗 will contain the score that customer 𝒾 has given to product 𝑗. For example if it’s a review this could be a number from 1–5, or it might just be 0–1 indicating if a user has bought an item or not. This matrix contains a lot of missing information, it’s unlikely a customer has bought every item on Amazon! Recommender systems aim to fill in this missing information, by predicting the customer score of items where the score is missing. Then recommender systems will recommend items to the customer that have the highest score. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method works by trying to factorise the matrix 𝑅 into two lower dimensional matrices 𝑈 and 𝑉, so that 𝑅=𝑈ᵀ𝑉.\n",
    "Suppose that R has dimension 𝒅₁×𝒅₂, then U will have dimension 𝑫×𝒅₁ and V will have dimension 𝑫×𝒅₂. Here 𝑫 is chosen by the user, it needs to be large enough to encode the nuances of 𝑅, but making it too large will make performance slow and could lead to overfitting. A typical size of 𝑫 is 20.\n",
    "\n",
    " Imputing the data might work, but it makes the methods very slow. Instead, most popular methods focus only on the matrix entries 𝑅𝒾𝑗 that are known, and fit the factorisation to minimise the error of these known 𝑅𝒾𝑗. A problem with doing this though is that predictions will be bad because of overfitting. The methods get around this by using a procedure known as regularisation, which is a common way to reduce overfitting."

So for the remainder of the tutorial we’ll show you how to tune the parameters of SVD++ and evaluate the performance of the method. The method SVD++, as well as most other matrix factorisation algorithms, will depend on a number of main tuning constants: the dimension DD affecting the size of UU and VV; the learning rate, which affects the performance of the optimisation step; the regularisation term affecting the overfitting of the model; and the number of epochs, which determines how many iterations of optimisation are used.\n",

In theory, the regularisation parameter can be any positive real value, but in practice it is limited as setting it too small will result in overfitting, while setting it too large will result in poor performance; so trying a list of reasonable values should be fine"
