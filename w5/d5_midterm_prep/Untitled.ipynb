    "These delays not only cause inconveniences to the airlines but also to the passengers. The result is an increase in travel time which increases the expenses associated with food and lodging and ultimately causes stress among passengers. The airlines are victims of extra costs associated to their crews, aircraft repositioning, fuel consumption while trying to reduce elapse times, and many others which together tamper their reputation and often result in a loss of demand by passengers.
