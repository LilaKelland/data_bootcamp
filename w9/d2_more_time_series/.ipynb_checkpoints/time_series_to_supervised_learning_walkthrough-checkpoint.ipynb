    "# How to Convert a Time Series to a Supervised Learning Problem in Python\n",

    "A supervised learning problem is comprised of input patterns (X) and output patterns (y), such that an algorithm can learn how to predict the output patterns from the input patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas shift() Function\n",
    "A key function to help transform time series data into a supervised learning problem is the Pandas shift() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a DataFrame, the shift() function can be used to create copies of columns that are pushed forward (rows of NaN values added to the front) or pulled back (rows of NaN values added to the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the behavior required to create columns of lag observations as well as columns of forecast observations for a time series dataset in a supervised learning format."

    "Running the example shows a new column with a NaN value as the last value.\n",

    "Technically, in time series forecasting terminology the current time (t) and future times (t+1, t+n) are forecast times and past observations (t-1, t-n) are used to make forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see how positive and negative shifts can be used to create a new DataFrame from a time series with sequences of input and output patterns for a supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This permits not only classical X -> y prediction, but also X -> Y where both input and output can be sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the shift function also works on so-called multivariate time series problems. That is where instead of having one set of observations for a time series, we have multiple (e.g. temperature and pressure). All variates in the time series can be shifted forward or backward to create multivariate input and output sequences. \n",

    "## The series_to_supervised() Function\n",

    "\n",
    "* data: Sequence of observations as a list or 2D NumPy array. Required.\n",
    "* n_in: Number of lag observations as input (X). Values may be between [1..len(data)] Optional. Defaults to 1.\n",
    "* n_out: Number of observations as output (y). Values may be between [0..len(data)-1]. Optional. Defaults to 1.\n",
    "* dropnan: Boolean whether or not to drop rows with NaN values. Optional. Defaults to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a single value:\n",
    "\n",
    "* return: Pandas DataFrame of series framed for supervised learning.\n"
